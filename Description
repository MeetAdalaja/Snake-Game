As a part of my programming experience, I have designed and developed a fully functional Snake Game using HTML, CSS, and primarily JavaScript, which features increasing levels of difficulty as the player progresses. In addition to the increasing difficulties, the game also includes sound effects for every move with background music, a scoring system that increases when the snake consumes food, and a high score tracking system that is stored in local storage.
